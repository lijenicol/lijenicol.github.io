				<p class="project-title">Aurora Render.</p>
				<p>Aurora Render is a personal ray tracer I built in C++ based upon the book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend". Since creating the base ray tracer from the book,
					I have extended its functionality so that I can experiment with different rendering methods and features. The ray tracer currently supports
					basic geometry (such as disks, spheres, rectangles, triangles), BVH construction, mesh loading, image texturing, environment mapping and basic diffuse/transparent materials.
					I plan to turn this ray tracer into a full physically based renderer in the future, taking inspiration from the book "Physically Based Rendering".

				<p class="project-title">Cinema Engine.</p>
				<p>This project reflects my love for movies and modern video games - it is a graphics engine that incorporates many post-processing and aesthetic features. Most of the work was dedicated to the rendering in the 2 weeks I had to work on it - I designed an engine that integrates motion blur, bloom, fog, and exposure control, all wrapped up in a deferred rendering pipeline.</p>

				<p class="project-title">eProfolio.</p>
				<p>This project was handpicked to present at the University of Melbourne 2020 CIS seminar. 
					eProfolio is a platform that enables users to create their own ePortfolios and share their
					work with others. It is a web app that was created as part of a group project for the 
					capstone CS subject at unimelb. I played a vital part in my team, being the main designer 
					and frontend developer. For more information on the dev process, <a class="white" href="/eprofolio.html">read here</a>.

				<p class="project-title">SPH Fluid Simulator.</p>
				<p>This project is an implementation of SPH simulation in C++. I have a love/hate relationship with this project -
					I was first tasked to complete it as a final assignment to a Computer Animation class, however I could not seem
					to get the physics right. After many nights spent trying to debug the problem, I handed it in incomplete, leaving me 
					dissapointed. 8 months later I was determined to get it right and it only took me one hour to find a solution to my problem 
					- I only had to remove one direction vector from the viscosity calculations and it fixed everything. After this fix,
					I implemented spatial hashing to speed up neighbourhood search, and set up instanced rendering to reduce rendering bottlenecks.
					The system is capable of simulating ~3000 particles in real time before it starts to drop below 25fps.

				<p class="project-title">Cloth Toy.</p>
				<p>Cloth Toy is an interactive application that allows the user to move a piece of cloth around the scene through direct control of individual vertices or by controlling the "wind". The cloth itself is made up of a collection of interconnected springs which give the illusion of an elastic material. All physics and rendering were programmed myself in C++ and OpenGL.</p>
