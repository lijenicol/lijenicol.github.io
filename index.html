				<p id="about-title" class="primary-text highlight-b">A Quick Description of Myself.</p>
				<p id="about-text" class="secondary-text">I am a student at the <span class="highlight-b">University of Melbourne</span>, undertaking a Bachelor of Science degree. My passion for computers and graphics has lead me to studying a computer science major and it has also taken me overseas where I studied computer graphics at <span class="highlight-b">UC San Diego</span> for a semester. Other academic interests of mine include mathematics and physics. When I am not studying, I am out <span class="highlight-b">designing for social media</span>, <span class="highlight-b">making films</span> and <span class="highlight-b">hanging with friends</span>. Below are some projects that I have worked on over the years.</p>

				<p class="project-title">Cinema Engine.</p>
				<p>This project reflects my love for movies and modern video games - it is a graphics engine that incorporates many post-processing and aesthetic features. Most of the work was dedicated to the rendering in the 2 weeks I had to work on it - I designed an engine that integrates motion blur, bloom, fog, and exposure control, all wrapped up in a deferred rendering pipeline.</p>

				<p class="project-title">SPH Simulator.</p>
				<p>This project is built upon the Navier Stokes equations and various different academic papers published over the years. It was a challenging project to put together as making minor changes to any variable can vary the results drastically, making it difficult to debug. However, with some tweaking, the user can create different fluids with reasonable stability.</p>

				<p class="project-title">Cloth Toy.</p>
				<p>Cloth Toy is an interactive application that allows the user to move a piece of cloth around the scene through direct control of individual vertices or by controlling the "wind". The cloth itself is made up of a collection of interconnected springs which give the illusion of an elastic material. All physics and rendering were programmed myself in C++ and OpenGL.</p>

				<p>Shadow Build is a game built in Java as a project to demonstrate Object Oriented Software principles. The user can control entities named "Scouts" to collect resources spread across the map. The resources can be spent to craft other entities or to build more structures around the world.</p>

				<p class="project-title">The Book of Nehemiah.</p>
				<p>This is a short promotional video that I shot, scored and edited for Waterfront Christian Church. This film drew heavy inspiration from promotional videos shot by MOSAIC - I aimed to combine simplicity and storytelling into one video.</p>
