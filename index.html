				<p class="project-title">Cinema Engine.</p>
				<p>This project reflects my love for movies and modern video games - it is a graphics engine that incorporates many post-processing and aesthetic features. Most of the work was dedicated to the rendering in the 2 weeks I had to work on it - I designed an engine that integrates motion blur, bloom, fog, and exposure control, all wrapped up in a deferred rendering pipeline.</p>

				<p class="project-title">eProfolio.</p>
				<p>eProfolio is a platform that enables users to create their own ePortfolios and share their
					work with others. It is a web app that was created as part of a group project for the 
					capstone CS subject at unimelb. I played a vital part in my team, being the main designer 
					and frontend developer. For more information on the dev process, <a class="white" href="/eprofolio.html">read here</a>.

				<p class="project-title">Cloth Toy.</p>
				<p>Cloth Toy is an interactive application that allows the user to move a piece of cloth around the scene through direct control of individual vertices or by controlling the "wind". The cloth itself is made up of a collection of interconnected springs which give the illusion of an elastic material. All physics and rendering were programmed myself in C++ and OpenGL.</p>

				<p class="project-title">SPH Simulator.</p>
				<p>This project is built upon the Navier Stokes equations and various different academic papers published over the years. It was a challenging project to put together as making minor changes to any variable can vary the results drastically, making it difficult to debug. However, with some tweaking, the user can create different fluids with reasonable stability.</p>
