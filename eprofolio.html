                When applying for jobs, people need a way to bundle all of their work together
                into one folio. This process can be difficult, as people may find it difficult
                to know which work to include and how to format their folio correctly.
                The aim of this project was to provide a service that users can use
                to create their own ePortfolios easily. Users can use pre existing templates,
                or create their own in our workspace, which they can share for others to use.
                Our clients wanted a product that felt a lot like "Notion", a popular
                notetaking software. They also wanted a website that felt slick and easy
                to use.

            <p class="secondary-text highlight bold">My Work:</p>
            <p class="secondary-text highlight">
                I played a vital part in the creation of the final product. In the team, I was 
                the main designer and frontend developer. At the start of the project, I developed
                prototypes in Figma & Photoshop, which I would then send off to the client to receive feedback.
                After a couple of prototypes and designs, we arrived at a common theme among the website.
                When this stage was done, it was time to develop the product. At first, I had never
                used React - however, after a couple of weeks I had become proficient enough to create
                functional components and a functional product. After 12 weeks of development, I was 
                able to create a fully functioning app that both worked well and felt good to use. Below
                I have included a few before and after pictures that show the difference between the first
                mockups and the final product.
